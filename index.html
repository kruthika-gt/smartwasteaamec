            <p>Smart waste management is an innovative approach to handling and collecting waste. Based on IoT (Internet of Things) technology, smart waste management provides data on waste generation patterns and behavior. This empowers municipalities, cities, and waste collectors to optimize their waste operations, become more sustainable, and make more intelligent business decisions.
   
            The waste sector has traditionally been a static industry. And it is only in recent years that we have started to see modernizations to the ways of working in waste management.
                       
            With the birth of IoT technology and new innovations becoming commercially available, waste authorities are increasingly looking to smart solutions, as a way of addressing budget cuts and ambitious sustainability targets.</p>

           <p>In todayâ€™s ever-changing and unpredictable world, the waste    sector needs a solution that empowers event-driven waste collection. Waste authorities need to move away from relying on historical waste trends and patterns that are no longer applicable to our modern way of life.
   
            The entire waste industry needs a solution that utilizes real-time data to make sure that waste containers are only picked up when needed. And this is where smart waste management comes in.</p>

           <p>A digital overview of your containers and waste inventory is an essential component of smart waste management. Container tracking provides you with transparency of your waste planning processes thanks to high-accuracy data on the location and movements of bins.
   
           Integrating container tracking as part of your waste solutions will enable you to optimize your inventory management so you can easily schedule container maintenance, keep track of damage bins, and protect your bins against theft.</p>
